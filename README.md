## Title
Weight Lifting App

## Description
Takes in a weight in lbs and the number of reps you lifted it. It then returns a calculated max you could possibly do  
along with the calculated percentages of the largest calculated max.

For example: say you benched press 255 lb for 10 reps. The app would take those numbers and use the 3 most popular  
max calculation equations and calculate your estimated max bench press.
